## Hi!

This repo is the host for a [Pi-Hole Adlist](https://docs.pi-hole.net/database/gravity) of phishing domains! This is regularly updated according to the [Sinking Yacht API!](https://phish.sinking.yachts/v2/text)

You can check out the Official Fish-Fish Github Org over [here!](https://github.com/fishfish-gg)

You can add this to your Pi-Hole instance by going to your Pi-Hole site, going to "Adlists", and adding [this address!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/User9684/fishfish-pihole/master/hosts)
